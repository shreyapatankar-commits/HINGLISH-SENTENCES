# Hinglish Emotion Dataset

This repository contains the Hinglish emotion dataset used in the paper
"Hinglish-EKG: A Multi-Relational Emotion Knowledge Graph for Code-Mixed Emotion Analysis".

The dataset consists of Roman-script Hinglish social media sentences
annotated with four emotion categories:
- anger
- happy
- sad
- neutral

This dataset is used exclusively for Hinglish-EKG construction and evaluation.
Other datasets under the same GitHub account (e.g., Marathi datasets)
are not part of this study.
